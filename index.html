			<li>Get on bord with the Mediterranean diet</li>
	<p>Eat like a tourist in Greece. The sunset over your office park isn't as stunning as the one over an Aegean beach, but a plate of grilled fish and fresh vegetables is as delicious in Athens, Georgia, as it is in Athens, Greece</p>

			<li>Cook at home more</li>
	<p>Sure, you could inhale supper straight out of a bucket, but for a healthy meal, you need to invest at least a few minutes in chopping, rinsing or grilling. The result is worth the effort. When you prepare dishes yourself, you can see exactly which ingredients are going into it and make conscious choices about what you truly want to eat</p>
